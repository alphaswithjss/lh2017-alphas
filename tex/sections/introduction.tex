In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the strong coupling constant ($\alpha_s$) is responsible for the strength of interactions between quarks and gluons.
%
Governed by this fundamental parameter, a plethora of strong-force phenomena emerge, including the binding of partons into massive hadrons that are responsible for most of the visible energy-density in the universe, and the creation of collimated sprays of hadrons known as jets that are ubiquitous at high-energy particle colliders.
%
The internal structure of jets (jet substructure) has been extensively exploited to search for new particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
%
Now that both the theoretical and experimental tools of jet substructure have reached a high degree of maturity~\cite{Abdesselam:2010pt,Altheimer:2012mn,Altheimer:2013yza,Adams:2015hiv,Larkoski:2017jix}, it is time to ask if the radiation patterns inside jets can be used to extract fundamental parameters of the Standard Model, such as $\alpha_s$.

There is a strong motivation (pun intended) for making a precise measurement of $\alpha_s$.
%
The uncertainty in $\alpha_s$ is a limiting factor in our predictions for the stability of the universe~\cite{Andreassen:2017rzq}, and the
uncertainty in $\alpha_s$ at a variety of scales sets a model-independent sensitivity to strongly-interacting particles beyond the Standard Model~\cite{Kaplan:2008pt,Becciolini:2014lya}.
%
Now that many scattering processes have been calculated to a high perturbative order, the uncertainty on $\alpha_s$ ($\sigma_{\alpha_s}$) can be limiting in the overall accuracy; numerically $\alpha_s^3\sim \sigma_{\alpha_s}$, so higher-order terms can be smaller than the leading-order correction uncertainty (see e.g.\ $gg\rightarrow H$ at N$^3$LO~\cite{Anastasiou:2015ema}).
%
Determinations of $\alpha_s$ probe a wide variety of physical phenomena, and the consistency between methods is both a crucial test of the theory and an important ingredient to make accurate predictions for the LHC and beyond.

The world-average value for $\alpha_s$ at the $Z$ boson mass ($m_Z$) is $0.118\pm 0.0013$, an impressive $1.1\%$ total uncertainty~\cite{Olive:2016xmw}.%
\footnote{Unless otherwise specified, we always report $\alpha_s$ at the $Z$ boson mass in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme.} 
%
There have been significant discussions in the community about the challenges and validity of various methods to extract $\alpha_s$ (see for instance \Refs{Bethke:2011tr,Altarelli:2013bpa,Pich:2013sqa,Moch:2014tta,dEnterria:2015kmd,Olive:2016xmw,Salam:2017qdl}).
%
The most precise (and dominant) input to the world average is the $\alpha_s$ value from lattice QCD calculations combined with measurements of $B$-hadron mass differences, with an uncertainty that is less than $1\%$. 
%
After the lattice, the most precise determination is from measurements and calculations of thrust and the $C$-parameter in $e^+e^-$ collisions~\cite{Abbate:2010xh,Hoang:2015hka,Heister:2003aj,Abdallah:2004xe,Abreu:1996mk,Abreu:1999rc,Biebel:1999zt,Adeva:1992gv,Abbiendi:2004qz,Abe:1994mf}.
%
These methods are sensitive to very different regimes of QCD and, interestingly, differ from each other at about the 5\% level, corresponding to a more than $3\sigma$ tension.

%
The measurement using the CMS top cross-section measurement is the first NNLO extraction at the LHC~\cite{Chatrchyan:2013haa}.
%
The other points are the $\alpha_s$ parameter value used in the final state shower in various PS generaters: \herwig~\cite{Bellm:2015jjp} and \sherpa~\cite{Gleisberg:2008ta} use the world-average by default, while \pythia~\cite{Sjostrand:2006za,Sjostrand:2014zea} employs a higher value in both the Monash default tune~\cite{Skands:2014pea} and the A14 tunes (with VAR2 as an A14 uncertainty variation)~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021}.
%
The order at which $\alpha_s$ is utilized is not the same in all cases.}

Extractions based on $e^+e^-$ event shapes are sensitive to soft and collinear regions of phase space, which are modeled with precision
using higher-order resummation.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:propaganda} shows various values of $\alpha_s$ extracted with next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) calculations including various levels of resummation, such as next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^3$LL) for the thrust-based extraction.
%
Also shown are the values of $\alpha_s$ used as inputs to various Parton Shower (PS) generators.%
\footnote{Note that these programs implement much more than just the QCD parton shower.  For example, radiated photons are also generated, though the impact of those electroweak processes is quite negligible here (as opposed to photons from $\pi^0\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$).}
%
The value of $\alpha_s$ in the final-state PS is also sensitive to the soft and collinear regime of QCD (albeit in different ways); interestingly, the values used in the \pythia program~\cite{Sjostrand:2006za,Sjostrand:2007gs}, which are fit to $e^+e^-$ event shape data, suggest a higher value of $\alpha_s$ than the lattice result by about 15\%.
%
Another challenge with the event-shape extraction is that non-perturbative (NP) corrections are nearly degenerate with changes to $\alpha_s$ \cite{Abbate:2010xh}.
%
This is in part because techniques to parametrically separate NP effects from perturbative effects (i.e.~jet grooming techniques to be discussed below) were not mature at the time of the Large Electron Positron (LEP) collider, and because the energy scale at LEP did not allow for a large lever-arm between energy scales.
%
The sensitivity to low-energy scales where QCD is in the NP regime is also a key challenge for the lattice determination.
%
It would therefore be timely for a precision extraction of $\alpha_s$ using jets at the LHC.

For most analyses at the LHC so far, jets have been used mainly as proxies for quark and gluon four-vectors.
%
The multiplicity and kinematics of jets in purely hadronic final states can be predicted to high $\alpha_s$ orders in perturbation theory with e.g.\ NNLOJET~\cite{Currie:2016bfm,Currie:2017ctp} and NLOJet++~\cite{Nagy:2001fj,Nagy:2003tz}.
%
As a result, measurements of jet multiplicities, energies, and angles can be used to extract $\alpha_s$~\cite{ATLAS:2015yaa,Aaboud:2017fml,Khachatryan:2014waa,CMS:2014mna,Chatrchyan:2013txa}.
%
Even though these measurements have achieved an uncertainty of around $5\%$, they have not yet been included in the Particle Data Group (PDG) combination~\cite{Olive:2016xmw} since they are using only next-to-leading-order (NLO) theory calculations.
%
With recent progress in higher-order calculations, this will likely change soon, and it is noteworthy that an extraction using the recent NNLO $t\bar{t}$ cross-section \cite{Czakon:2013goa} is now included (see \Fig{fig:propaganda}).

In extractions based on fixed-order perturbation theory, the collinear region defining the internal
structure of jets is avoided in part due to the lack of precision calculations.%
\footnote{Logarithms of the jet radius $R$ may be important when the jet radius is small, and there are techniques to incorporate these corrections into fixed-order calculations~\cite{Dasgupta:2016bnd,Dasgupta:2014yra}.}
%
It is important to remember that jets are not in one-to-one correspondence with individual quarks and gluons, but rather to clusters of quarks and gluons; for this reason, the substructure of jets is also governed by $\alpha_s$.
%
Recent theoretical and experimental advances in jet substructure have shown that the radiation pattern inside jets has great physics potential~\cite{Abdesselam:2010pt,Altheimer:2012mn,Altheimer:2013yza,Adams:2015hiv,Larkoski:2017jix}.
%
To date, the focus of jet substructures studies has been mostly on tagging the origin of jets and searching for physics beyond the Standard Model.
%
However, present and future precision may be sufficient to make a useful measurement of $\alpha_s$.

A key tool to facilitate a substructure extraction of $\alpha_s$ are jet grooming techniques, which systematically removes soft and wide-angle radiation from jets \cite{Butterworth:2008iy,Ellis:2009su,Ellis:2009me,Krohn:2009th,Dasgupta:2013ihk,Larkoski:2014wba}.
%
Jet grooming can parametrically separate the NP radiation in the jet from the hard perturbatively-described components.
%
At a hadron collider, grooming also mitigates the contribution from the underlying event and additional nearly simultaneous interactions (pileup).
%
Theoretical calculations for groomed observables have been performed at NLL~\cite{Marzani:2017kqd,Marzani:2017mva} and NNLL~\cite{Frye:2016aiz,Frye:2016okc} accuracy and will be extended to higher orders as calculations become available.
%
Recently, ATLAS~\cite{Aaboud:2017qwh} and CMS~\cite{CMS-PAS-SMP-16-010} demonstrated 5-10\% measurement uncertainties of these calculated quantities using existing technologies.

The purpose of this paper is to study the feasibility of a measurement of $\alpha_s$ using jet substructure at the LHC, using jet shapes that are infrared and collinear (IRC) safe.
%
Similar techniques would of course also be interesting at both a low- and high-energy $e^+e^-$ collider; we focus here on $pp$ since high-quality data are now pouring out of the LHC.
%
We view this work as part of a broader program to apply jet grooming techniques for precision QCD (see also \Ref{Hoang:2017kmk} for
applications to the top quark mass).
%
There are significant experimental and theoretical challenges to achieve success in this program, but we believe it is possible with community synergy.
%
An $\alpha_s$ extraction represents a concrete goal to push the accuracy and understanding of jet substructure calculations in particular and QCD calculations more generally.

This remainder of this work is organized as follows.
%
In \Sec{sec:definitions}, we define the observables and grooming strategies that will be considered in this paper.
%
In \Sec{sec:softcomplications}, we highlight a number of theoretical and experimental benefits of jet grooming, which make groomed observables particularly interesting for extractions of $\alpha_s$.
%
In \Sec{sec:jetmass}, we discuss the sensitivity of groomed jet mass to the value of $\alpha_s$ using both analytic expressions and PS generators.
%
In \Sec{sec:ben_study}, an idealized setup is used to illustrate how an extraction of $\alpha_s$ might work at the LHC, using realistic estimates of both the theoretical and experimental uncertainties.
%
We conclude in \Sec{sec:future} and discuss future directions for improving both the theoretical and experimental uncertainties for $\alpha_s$ extractions from jet substructure.

%Grooming in general (broader appeal; also try to avoid the use of the word soft drop).

%Then in pp we have to use jets, so that means jet substructure.  Grooming also removes UE, etc.  Also complementary to other pp extraction methods.

%Benefit of hadron collider: larger lever arm (interesting in and of itself, and also to stay away from NP effects).  Also, we have a hadron collider now with precision!

%Ref.~\cite{Hoang:2017kmk}

%Goal of this study: in addition to alpha s itself, we want to demonstrate the broader applicability of grooming techniques for precision QCD; in contrast, most applications so far are for tagging.  Make a connection to the top mass.  Therefore, we begin with a general introduction to these grooming techniques blah blah and then blah blah.

%(mention our simultaneous q/g fraction extraction - this is new independent of JSS)

=====

A new class of jet substructure observables have been introduced that are amenable to precision calculations and therefore introduce the possibility of an $\alpha_s$ extraction from the radiation pattern within a jet for the first time.  Precision jet substructure is an active field of research with a general understanding of infrared and collinear (IRC) safe observables at leading logarithm (LL) as well as analytic control over a variety of many other infrared~\cite{Larkoski:2013paa,Larkoski:2015lea} or collinear~\cite{Elder:2017bkd,Krohn:2012fg,Waalewijn:2012sv,Chang:2013rca} unsafe observables.  Many results have also been extended to next-to-leading logarithm (NLL), including the jet mass~\cite{} and other jet shapes~\cite{}.  However, until recently most of these NLL results ignored the contribution from \textit{non-global logarithms} (NGLs).  These contributions from radiation that connects the intra- and inter-jet regions formally arise at NLL and are difficult to calculate in perturbation theory.  By studying the analytic structure of various jet grooming techniques, it was observed that one could remove the sensitivity to NGLs through a modification of existing grooming procedures~\cite{Dasgupta:2013ihk,Dasgupta:2013via}.  Since that time, an entire class of grooming techniques have been constructed with this property, known as \textit{soft drop}~\cite{Larkoski:2014wba}.  --> Grooming in general.

Jet substructure has proven to be a powerful set of techniques for tagging blah blah~\cite{Abdesselam:2010pt,Altheimer:2012mn,Altheimer:2013yza,Adams:2015hiv}.  This study suggests blah blah.  This paper is organized as follows.
