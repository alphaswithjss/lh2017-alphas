Soft drop mass is most accurate jet substructure observable to date.  Review soft drop, and current calculations

\subsection{Soft Drop Declustering}

Review of soft drop


The Soft Drop grooming procedure~\cite{Larkoski:2014wba} takes a jet
with momentum $p_t$ and radius $R$. It re-clusters its constituents
using the Cambridge/Aachen (C/A) algorithm \cite{Dokshitzer:1997in,
  Wobisch:1998wt} and iteratively performs the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item it de-clusters the jet into 2 subjets $j \to j_1 + j_2$;
 \item it checks the condition 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sd-condition}
\frac{\min (p_{t1} , p_{t2})}{p_{t1}+p_{t2}} > \zcut \left(
  \frac{\theta_{12}}{R}\right)^\beta\,;
\end{equation}
\item if the jet passes the condition, the recursion stops; if not the
  softer subjet is removed and the algorithms goes back to step 1 with
  the hardest of the two subjets. 
 \end{enumerate}
In the case $\beta=0$ Soft Drop essentially reduces to mMDT~\cite{Dasgupta:2013ihk},
 albeit without any actual mass-drop condition. Moreover, while the
 original MDT~\cite{Butterworth:2008iy} algorithm imposed a cut on the ratio of angular distances
 to masses, a so-called $\ycut$, the mMDT variant instead cuts on
 momentum fractions~\cite{Dasgupta:2013ihk} (see
 e.g. \cite{Dasgupta:2013ihk,Dasgupta:2016ktv} for a comparison
 between $\ycut$ and $\zcut$).

Plot of the two calculations?  Show plots of the ATLAS and CMS measurements?  Response matrices?  Actually, I'm not sure we can show CMS since it is only preliminary. 

Say something about mass versus $k_t$?
