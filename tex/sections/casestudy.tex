Soft drop mass is most accurate jet substructure observable to date.  Review soft drop, and current calculations

\subsection{Soft Drop Declustering}

Review of soft drop


The Soft Drop grooming procedure~\cite{Larkoski:2014wba} takes a jet
with momentum $p_t$ and radius $R$. It re-clusters its constituents
using the Cambridge/Aachen (C/A) algorithm \cite{Dokshitzer:1997in,
  Wobisch:1998wt} and iteratively performs the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item it de-clusters the jet into 2 subjets $j \to j_1 + j_2$;
 \item it checks the condition 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sd-condition}
\frac{\min (p_{t1} , p_{t2})}{p_{t1}+p_{t2}} > \zcut \left(
  \frac{\theta_{12}}{R}\right)^\beta\,;
\end{equation}
\item if the jet passes the condition, the recursion stops; if not the
  softer subjet is removed and the algorithms goes back to step 1 with
  the hardest of the two subjets. 
 \end{enumerate}
In the case $\beta=0$ Soft Drop essentially reduces to mMDT~\cite{Dasgupta:2013ihk},
 albeit without any actual mass-drop condition. Moreover, while the
 original MDT~\cite{Butterworth:2008iy} algorithm imposed a cut on the ratio of angular distances
 to masses, a so-called $\ycut$, the mMDT variant instead cuts on
 momentum fractions~\cite{Dasgupta:2013ihk} (see
 e.g. \cite{Dasgupta:2013ihk,Dasgupta:2016ktv} for a comparison
 between $\ycut$ and $\zcut$).

\subsection{Method 1 (name?) Analytic Calculation}

Andrew, et al.

\subsection{Method 2 (name?)  Analytic Calculation}

Simone and Gregory, et al.

Do we want a comparison plot of the two calculations?
(calculated at NNLL, good enough to start extraction)

\subsection{Concrete Benefits of Grooming}

Show that grooming does what's advertised in \Sec{sec:softcomplications}.
Reduced sensitivity to NP effects but also better agreement with MC?
