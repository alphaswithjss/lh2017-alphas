\abstract{
Recent advances in jet substructure have led to a new class of jet observables that are amenable to systematically-improvable calculations and are robust to the complex environment of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
%
These observables exploit grooming to reduce non-perturbative contributions and simplify perturbative calculations.
%
With these recent advances in both theory and experiment, we believe it is the appropriate time to begin investigating the possibility of extracting the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ from jet substructure.
%
In this paper, we perform a proof-of-principle sensitivity study to demonstrate the suitability of such measurements to add useful information to the existing precision extractions of $\alpha_s$.
%
We highlight a number of theoretical and experimental advantages of using groomed observables for $\alpha_s$ extraction, and we discuss several difficulties of the LHC environment.
%
Using a simplified approach, we show that a measurement of $\alpha_s$ with an approximate 10\% uncertainty should be feasible at the LHC.
%
This result motivates a complete analysis with a full set of theoretical and experimental considerations, and we present a number of directions where improvements on both the theory and experiment sides could be made in the near future.

%\info{All}

In this paper, we performed a preliminary study assessing a possible extraction of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ from groomed jet substructure measurements at the LHC.
%
This has been made possible by recent advances in the calculation of groomed event shapes, which allow them to be resummed to NNLL accuracy, as well as advances in the understanding of the experimental uncertainties for groomed jet observables.
 
We have highlighted a number of features that an extraction of $\alpha_s$ from groomed substructure would offer.
%
In particular, the grooming procedure suppresses NP hadronization corrections to the mass distribution, extending the range of perturbative control by up to a factor of $\sim 100$ as compared to the ungroomed case, where hadronization corrections are a dominant uncertainty.
%
Furthermore, the nature of the NP corrections is completely different, and therefore a groomed extraction could provide complementary information to event shape measurements at LEP and other $e^+e^-$ colliders. 

Using the groomed jet mass as a concrete example, we performed a feasibility study for the extraction of $\alpha_s$ from groomed jet substructure.
%
Considered separately, the groomed quark and gluon distributions both exhibit good sensitivity to $\alpha_s$.
%
However, this study also highlighted a key issue relevant at the LHC.
%
The leading behavior of the shape of the distribution is sensitive to the product $\alpha_s C_i$, where $C_i$ is the color Casimir factor, namely $C_A$ for gluon jets and $C_F$ for quark jets.
%
This immediately implies that there is a degeneracy between the value of $\alpha_s$ and the quark/gluon fraction of the sample.
%
We highlighted two possible ways of overcoming this degeneracy, either by a fixed-order calculation of the quark and gluon fractions, or by a simultaneous measurement of different substructure observables.
%
This would ideally be combined with multiple samples with (relatively pure~\cite{Gallicchio:2011xc}) quark/gluon fractions.
%
While we expect significantly better precision to be achievable by the explicit calculation, this would introduce a stronger dependence on the PDFs which then should ideally be fitted simultaneously.

With currently achievable experimental and theoretical uncertainties, we have shown that an extraction of $\alpha_s$ at the $10\%$ level is realistic using the currently available data at the LHC.
%
We believe that this study motivates a serious effort to extract the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ from jet substructure at the LHC using groomed jet shapes.
%
A serious analysis will require advances on both the theory and experiment sides, so we conclude by discussing some of the major obstacles that must be overcome.

On the theory side, we can separately discuss three primary aspects of the calculation:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Resummation Accuracy:} For $e^+e^-$ event shapes, the current state of the art is N$^3$LL.
%
This has been achieved only for a few select observables using soft-collinear effective theory.
%
The extension to N$^3$LL accuracy for the groomed jet mass would require only the calculation of the anomalous dimensions for the groomed soft function to three loops, which is possible using currently available techniques.
%
At this level of accuracy, it will also be important to asses perturbative power corrections in $\zcut$.
%
While \Refs{Marzani:2017kqd,Marzani:2017mva} have shown that these corrections are numerically small, they may become important if multiple $z_\text{cut}$ values are used that are not much less than one.
%
\item {\bf Fixed-Order Matching:} A key aspect, and a potential complication to achieve theoretical accuracy competitive with $e^+e^-$ determinations, is fixed-order matching.
%
For $e^+e^-$, the perturbative corrections to $e^+e^- \to$ 3 jets are known to NNLO \cite{GehrmannDeRidder:2007hr,Gehrmann-DeRidder:2007nzq,Weinzierl:2008iv,Weinzierl:2009ms}.
%
To achieve a similar perturbative accuracy for the matching for the groomed jet mass will require $2\to 3$ matrix elements at NNLO.
%
While results for the amplitudes are just becoming available \cite{Gehrmann:2015bfy,Dunbar:2016aux,Badger:2013yda,Badger:2017jhb,Abreu:2017hqn}, it will be a while before numerically-efficient evaluations of the relevant cross-sections are available.
%
We believe that this is currently the theoretically most difficult ingredient.
%
\item {\bf Non-Perturbative Corrections:} Finally, in addition to improving our understanding of the perturbative accuracy of the observable, it will also be crucial to improve our understanding of the NP aspects of groomed observables.
%
While it has been shown through PS studies that NP effects are suppressed throughout a large component of the distribution, it will be important to quantify this further.
%
In the case of $e^+e^-$ event shapes, operator definitions of soft matrix elements allow for field theoretic definitions of the NP parameters.
%
Ideally this could also be performed for groomed observables, placing the groomed jet mass on a firmer theoretical footing.
%
\end{itemize}

Experimentally, there are three broad topics that need to be addressed for a precision extraction of $\alpha_s$:
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item {\bf Mass Scale Uncertainties:} At the moment, ATLAS~\cite{Aaboud:2017qwh} and CMS~\cite{CMS-PAS-SMP-16-010} have very different approaches for determining the jet mass scale uncertainty, both with known limitations.
%
CMS performs a fit to the hadronic $W$ boson mass peak in one-lepton $t\bar{t}$ events and takes the shift in the peak position as the uncertainty in the jet mass scale (which is negligible and thus ignored)~\cite{Sirunyan:2016cao}.
%
Two challenges with this approach are that (a) the peak position is a convolution of particle-level and detector-level effects and (b) it is not clear that uncertainties derived for boosted $W$ bosons should be the same as for generic quark and gluon jets at all masses.
%
One can overcome (a) with a technique like forward-folding~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2016-008,ATLAS-CONF-2016-035}.
%
Various PS generators can be studied, but it is likely not sufficient to have one global model comparison.
%
The impact on the jet mass resolution in one topology may be completely different than the impact of the scale, resolution, or acceptance in another topology.

By contrast, the ATLAS measurement propagates constituent-based uncertainties through to the groomed mass.
%
These uncertainties are derived from matching tracks to calorimeter-cell clusters and studying the energy and angular matching.
%
Studies have shown that this ``bottom-up'' approach works well for reproducing the jet energy scale~\cite{Aaboud:2016hwh}, which has been validated also for groomed jets in \Ref{Aaboud:2017qwh}.
%
However, this does not hold exactly for the mass, which is not linear in the constituent energies~\cite{Nachman:2016qyc}.
%
The uncertainties are validated using the standard ATLAS approach using track-jets~\cite{Aad:2013gja,ATLAS-CONF-2017-063}, but to achieve higher precision, a more detailed understanding of the impact of energy thresholds, fluctuation correlations, and calorimeter cluster merging will be required.
%
\item {\bf Mass Resolution Uncertainties:} ATLAS and CMS use their same respective approaches for the mass resolution as for the mass scale (i.e.\ bottom-up and $W$ mass peak).
%
ATLAS validates their approach in a similar manner as CMS, by using the $W$ mass peak from $t\bar{t}$ events.%
\footnote{This validation does not have the same complete forward-folding machinery as was used by ATLAS for trimmed jets.}
%
From \Fig{fig:expfit}, it seems that the mass resolution will not be the limiting factor, but it could be if the situation is not improved as the jet mass scale precision improves.
%
\item {\bf Pileup Modeling and Mitigation:} Grooming significantly reduces the impact of pileup, but if the Run 3+ data are to be used (pileup levels of 80+), then a significantly better and more detailed understanding of the degradation due to pileup will be required.
%
Statistical uncertainties are currently not dominant, so it is conceivable that the higher instantaneous luminosity data will not be required for the precision $\alpha_s$ extraction.
%
This may change if one wants to exploit the largest lever-arm possible; to access the highest $p_\text{T}$ jets, we will need more data.
%
\end{itemize}

We are optimistic that these difficulties on both the theory and experiment side can be overcome, enabling a precision probe of the strong coupling constant from jet substructure in the LHC environment.
%
We also hope that this study motivates additional investigations to broaden the potential toolbox for $\alpha_s$ extraction.
%
At minimum, it would be interesting to study in more detail the use of other observables beyond the two-point correlators as well as alternative grooming techniques beyond mMDT/Soft Drop.
%
More ambitiously, one potentially interesting direction is the use of track-based measurements, since it may be the case that it is ultimately experimental uncertainties that are the limiting factor.
%
From the experimental perspective, this significantly reduces uncertainties, particularly in a high pile-up environment.
%
From the theoretical side, however, it introduces the need for NP track functions.
%
That said, only certain moments of the track functions are required for special observables, and it may be possible to perform a combined fits for the moments of the track functions and $\alpha_s$, much like how fits are performed for $e^+e^-$ event shapes.
%
Significantly more theoretical work is required to see if this is truly a viable possibility, although we believe that this is well motivated.
